# Code-of-Conduct-for-Members


The purpose of our Community Code of Conduct is to ensure that all participants in the club have the best possible experience. We are all here to help each other learn, grow our skillsets and have a good time!

The BVP HEC Code of Conduct covers our behavior as members of the club, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, code repository, slack channel, gitter channel or meeting in college itself.

#### Be considerate.
Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect your colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

#### Be patient. 
This mostly applies to forums, mailing lists, and code contributions on github page. Communities are often built on volunteer time both from participants and organizers. It is possible that your question or code contribution or suggestion might not receive an immediate response. Be patient and consider the norms of the club. One reminder ping is welcome, many reminder pings in rapid succession are not a good display of patience. 

#### Be respectful.
Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. We expect members of the HEC club to be respectful when communicating with other club members.

#### Be nice.
Everyone in the club should feel welcome, regardless of their background. Please be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. No offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; no sexual images in public spaces, real or implied violence, intimidation, oppression, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention will not be tolerated.

#### Ask for help when unsure. 
Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

#### Communicate effectively.
We don't all speak the same language at the same skill level. Clear communication can help to avoid misunderstandings, as can remembering that our interpretations of words can be different depending on our backgrounds. Having context is important. It's better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions. 

#### In addition to these rules, members are requested to adhere by following rules also-:

- Since the coding competitions would be online held, So there should not be any discrepancy from core members side to participants. i.e. There must be no discrepancy of  problem statements being made available to participants before the event or the solutions given to the known participants.
- Decisions taken in core of the club must not get open to all until and unless decided b the group.
- No organizer must be found helping partcipant in solving problems.
